Why We Need Constructors in C#
  Why do we need Constructors in C#?
    Every class requires a constructor to be present in it if we want to create the instance of that class. Every class contains an implicit constructor if not defined explicitly by the 
    programmer and with the help of that implicit constructor, we can create the instance of that class.
    If we donâ€™t define any constructors, then an implicit constructor is there which is provided by the compiler at the time of compilation and using that implicit constructor we can create
    the instance, then the question is why do we need to define the constructor explicitly again or when do we need to define an explicit constructor in C#?

  What is the need of Defining a Constructor Explicitly Again?
    This is one of the frequently asked interview questions. Let us understand this. Implicit Constructors of a class will initialize variables of a class with the same value even if we create
    multiple instances of that class.
